## Sponsor
(100 words) In your own words, provide a brief description of the project sponsor organization here.
The organization is focused on maintaining the health of the local aquatic ecosystem and of the trout populations. 

## Scope

(100-200 words) In your own words, describe the problem that will be addressed in this project, Also, provide a broad overview of how you might approach it. 
I would work with the project organizers to figure out what questions they might want to ask of their data. Using their ecological knowledge and reviewing the literature would probably both be useful here. For instance, what would they expect to see from (say) E. coli data if the water quality was good? Based on that, I would identify what statistical tests would be appropriate. I would probably convert the data into a format readable by R and perform the analyses there. From the project description, I see that they are also curious about whether their sampling frequency is appropriate. I believe that I could tell them the confidence with which they are able to draw their conclusions, and they can decide whether they want to change their sampling frequency on that basis. 

## Vision

(100-200 words) In  your own words, describe what might result from this project. Be sure to describe both physical outputs *and the potential broader impacts of those outputs.* (e.g. how will they address problems/better society?) In this section, also describe, how your unique skills and interests can contribute to project success.  

I think the ideal result of this project will be a clear picture of the
